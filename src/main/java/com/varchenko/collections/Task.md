### Practice
* Make implementations of the CollectionExecutor for the following Collections
    * ArrayList<String>
    * LinkedList<String>
    * HashSet<String>
    * TreeSet<String> (OPTIONAL)
    * HashMap<String> (OPTIONAL)    

### Theory
#### Non Concurrent
* Describe the HashMap behavior when putting elements (bucket structure (list vs tree, how and when tree is created),
 rebalancing of HashMap).
* TreeMap. Structure and use cases
* LinkedHashMap

#### Concurrent 
* Concurrent vs Synchronized collections basics
* CopyOnWriteArrayList. Architecture and use cases. 

##### Optional 
* Pessimistic vs optimistic locks
